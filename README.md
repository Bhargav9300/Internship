**Problem Statement**: Three folders with images will be provided , all stored with unique names of which some images are similar and some are not. For this reason , two                        new folders are to be created , one containing all the unique images in it and the other folder containing the duplicate images. 

I have developed the code in which, the images are accessed from a folder and all the unique images are copied into "Unique" folder and all the duplicates are copied into "Duplicate" folder. 

**Inputs:**
1. Images folder path
2. Path of Unique images folder (To store all the unique images)
3. Path of Duplicate images folder( To store all the duplicate images)

**Output**
All the Unique images are stored in the unique images folder you have created and the duplicates are transferred to Duplicate images folder.
